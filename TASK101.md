- Don't copy each-others code.
- Follow proper naming convension.
- Submit each task in a separate folder.
```

`Submission procedure:`
```
- Suppose your roll no: 202183100x. Then, you have to create a folder with your registration number. Inside the folder, each task should have a different file (e.g. Task_101.cpp/Task_101.c)
The folder structure should look like this:

202183100x/

## Task_101

Draw a circle defining its xy-coordinates(center of the window) & radius.

## Task_102

Modify the drawing circle with its radius being increased over time. If it colides with any of the winows width or height, reset the radius with initial value.

## Task_103

- Draw a circle which moves towards its left to write continiously.
- Draw another circle(x = center of screen_width, y = 0). The second circle can be moved with key-inputs(up, down, left, right keys).
- Determine if any collision occurs between the two circle.
- Visual effect of collision.

## Bonus

Among the students who will use git for version controlling will get bonus marking.
