# Task 201: Project Work - 2nd task

As we have learned how to start a SDL project, it's time to make a legendary **SNAKE game** with it. You can follow these instructions for better Project management:

1. Setup Project Structure:

    - **Create Project Directory:** Set up a directory for your project.
    - **Initialize Version Control:** If using Git, initialize a Git repository. It is a mandatory process for all to submit this task using a github repository.

2. Setup SDL2:(Most of you have already submitted task101)

3. Game Initialization:

    - **Initialize SDL2:** Initialize SDL2 subsystems.
    - **Create Window:** Create the game window.
    - **Create Renderer:** Set up an SDL renderer for drawing.

 4. Game Loop:
    - **Handle Input:** Capture user input for controlling the snake.
    - **Update Logic:** Update the game logic (e.g., move the snake, check for collisions).
    - **Render Frame:** Draw the current state of the game.

## Must have features of SNAKE game 

1. Snake Implementation:
    - **Create Snake Class:** Implement a Snake class to represent the snake.
    - **Movement:** Implement snake movement logic.
    - **Growth:** Implement logic for the snake to grow when it consumes food.
    - **Collision Detection:** Detect collisions with the snake's own body and the game boundaries.

2. Food Generation:
    - **Generate Food:** Implement logic to randomly generate food on the screen.

3. Score Tracking:
    - **Display Score:** Show the player's current score on the screen.
    - **Increase Score:** Increase the score when the snake eats food.

4. Game Over:
    - **Collision Handling:** Implement logic for game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
    - **Display Game Over Screen:** Show a game over message and final score.


## Guideline

```
- Don't copy each-others code.
- Follow proper naming convension.
```

`Submission procedure:`

```
- Create a git repository
- Try to push feature-wise changes in the git repo
- Please don't push all the changes after completing the task at once. Try to push everyday with a proper commit message so that the changes can be identified. 
```
